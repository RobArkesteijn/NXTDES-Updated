            <p class="font-text text-left leading-7 font-light">On this website you'll find many travel destinations that might suit your preferences. From Europe al the way to New Zealand, there is so much to discover. Even though every place in the world is only a few button clicks away on your computer, there is nothing like discovering it with your own senses. The views, the smell, the warmth or the cold, rain, snow.. you name it. No place in this world is the same as the other. Some have better views, others have better weather, some have both. So get out there and discover, I hope I can inspire you to go to one of the places that you'll read about on this website.</p>
